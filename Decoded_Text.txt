Hello world, testing how this encoding program can encode an external text file. This would allow for more advanced messages to be encoded and transmitted to each other.


I wonder how advanced, like does this work with extra new lines between. 

Can i add numbers? -1 -2 -3 999








How many lines till I have an error?
